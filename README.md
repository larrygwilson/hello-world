My personal explorations into the world of data science

In early 2019 I began acquiring certifications related to data science through a program offered by Microsoft on the EdX platform.
The initial program offered by Microsoft, composed of 11 courses, was designed to be completed over a period of 4 quarters. 
After having completing the first quarter, I learned that Microsoft had decided to discontinue the program in December 2019, leaving myself and many others unable to complete the full course of study within the alloted time remaining. 

Being a complete beginner with no formal education in this field I have never the less decided to carry on to the best of my ability in 2020, utilizing resources available online, to learn what I can of data science in hopes of developing skills I can use to continue to earn income from home well into my retirement years.
